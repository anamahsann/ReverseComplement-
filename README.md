# ReverseComplement-
Python

Description:

This a program that prompts the user to enter an oligonucleotide sequence. 
If the user entered a valid oligo sequence consisting only of the characters A, C, G, or T, 
the program displays the reverse complement of that sequence.

After displaying the reverse complement, the program prompts the user to enter another 
sequence until the user enters a sequence with at least one character that is invalid. 
At this point, the program ends its run with a message that mentions that an invalid character was found, 
with no further prompting to the user.
